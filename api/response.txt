THOUGHTS: 

I need to protect my camp by eliminating the enemy camp. My friend is nearby, but I must watch out for the obstacles. The enemy is positioned at [7, 2], and there are no other enemy targets in sight. I need to move closer to the enemy camp and find a clear shot to attack.

ACTIONS: 

MOVE RIGHT

MOVE UP
ATTACK [7, 2]

THOUGHTS: I need to protect the camp and take down the enemy's camp. I need to be careful of the obstacles and make sure I don't hit any of my friends. 

ACTIONS: 
1. MOVE RIGHT to position [6, -6] to get a better view of the area. 
2. ATTACK [4, -7], taking out an enemy and avoiding hitting any of my friends. 
3. MOVE UP to position [6, -5] to get closer to the enemy's camp. 
4. ATTACK [6, -4], hopefully taking out another enemy.
